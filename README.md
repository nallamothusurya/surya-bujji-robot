## Overview

**Bujji** is a friendly, multilingual conversational voice assistant built with Flask and powered by Google's Gemini model. Designed to interact naturally and empathetically, Bujji provides text and voice responses, supports multiple languages, and can even open websites or system apps via conversational commands.

---

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Uses Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash) for natural, supportive, and context-aware responses.
- **Multilingual Support**: Detects and responds in the user's language; TTS supports many languages.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts AI responses to speech using Google TTS, delivered as audio.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken input to text via Google Speech Recognition.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Integrates current date and time into conversations for context.
- **App/Website Opening**: Recognizes commands to open external sites/apps (e.g., "open YouTube" ‚Üí "OPEN: https://www.youtube.com").
- **Profanity Handling**: Can mirror user tone, including mild profanity if contextually appropriate.
- **Caching**: In-memory caching for fast repeated queries and TTS responses.
- **Responsive Web UI**: Simple interface for chatting, listening, and speaking.

---

## How It Works

- **API Key**: Requires a Google Generative AI API key (`api_key` in the code).
- **Gemini Model**: Queries are sent to Gemini with a custom system instruction for friendly, human-like responses.
- **TTS**: Responses are spoken aloud using `gTTS`, with language detection via `langdetect`.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Users can submit audio; speech is transcribed using `speech_recognition`.
- **Web Interface**: Served via Flask, with endpoints for chat and speech.
